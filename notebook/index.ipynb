    "> In the proposed work, we created a fast and reliable end-to-end framework for medical image segmentation applications by employing a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a morphological active contour model. Traditionally, active contour based models have been utilized extensively for different segmentation tasks including medical image analysis, but their accuracy is very dependent on finding the right parameters and contour initialization. Moreover, although recent advances in deep CNNs have made it possible to train end-to-end segmentation networks with good performance, such networks tend to struggle with generalization issues as they are deployed on datasets that they have not been trained on. In our proposed pipeline, We leveraged a deep CNN, namely U-Net, to generate the initial segmentation masks, and then used such masks the the morphological model for creating the final mask. The proposed method has been implemented on a unified platform and is very efficient for both training and deployment. We tested this framework the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) data set for lung segmentation and results indicate enhanced performance in comparison to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. \n",
